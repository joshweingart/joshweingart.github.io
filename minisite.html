    <span class="first">Josh Weingart</span> (no relation) is a graphic designer living in Brooklyn. These are three of his favorite projects.

<br><br>
<p>
    <span class="first">SVA.edu 4.0</span> is a website redesign for the School of Visual Arts, an art and design college in New York City. 
<br><br>
    As the only full-time designer working exclusively on this project for over two years, I used Sketch, Principle, Zeplin, Framer, InVision, and Gitlab to design and prototype the site’s UI/UX, animations, and communicate tasks to developers. I was in charge of creating and exploring frontend and backend web components, maintaining design consistency across the site via a large Sketch library of dynamic components in multiple breakpoints, and (lots and lots of) QA testing.
<br><br>
    Overall, I made a total of 568 designs and 628 GitLab tickets.
<br><br>
    As part of the SVA’s in-house design studio, the Visual Arts Press, I worked with Gail Anderson, Eric Corriel, Brian Smith, Declan Van Welie, Ryan Durinick, Sam Potts, and Stephanie Gaito.

    <span class="first">Estée Lauder</span> was a freelance contract I took on after graduating. While there I worked with an art director designing ad banners, email newsletters, and web articles. Which were then used by the company as templates for future banners, newsletters, and articles.

    <span class="first">The Other 99</span> is the product of a 99 days of design challenge. Every day I designed a room and its blueprint, each one dedicated to a single activity, pop culture reference, joke, or occasionally all three. <a href="theother99/site.html">View Site</a>
