    <span class="first">Josh Weingart</span> (no relation) is a designer living in Brooklyn. He has spent the last two years designing and defining the School of Visual Arts' newly redesigned website. Here are three of his favorite projects:

    <p>
        <span class="first">SVA.edu 4.0</span> is a website redesign for the School of Visual Arts, an art and design college in New York City. 
    <br><br>
        As the only full-time designer working exclusively on this project for over two years, I used Sketch, Principle, Zeplin, Framer, InVision, and Gitlab to design and prototype the site’s UI/UX, animations, and communicate tasks to developers. I was in charge of creating and exploring frontend and backend web components, maintaining design consistency across the site via a large Sketch library of dynamic components in multiple breakpoints, and (lots and lots of) QA testing.
    <br><br>
        Overall, I made a total of 568 designs and 628 GitLab tickets.
    <br><br>
        As part of the SVA’s in-house design studio, the Visual Arts Press, I worked with Gail Anderson, Eric Corriel, Brian Smith, Declan Van Welie, Ryan Durinick, Sam Potts, and Stephanie Gaito.
