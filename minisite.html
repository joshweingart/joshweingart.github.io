    <span class="first">Dia:Beacon</span> is a visitors guide for the contemporary art museum barring the same name. The guide provides information about the displayed artists, while educating visitors about the surrounding area of Beacon, NY. Each artist is connected to a landmark of the Beacon area. For example, the disciplined work of Sol Lewitt connects to West Point military academy.
