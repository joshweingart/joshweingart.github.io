        <span class="first">Let's Look Back</span> is an ad campaign for the comedy news show Last Week Tonight. The show only airs once a week, so it often covers topics that arenâ€™t current events, despite being a current events show. My campaign delves deeper into a comedian delivering news from the past, by taking serious events from history and providing a humorous fact for each event. All copy is written by yours truly.
