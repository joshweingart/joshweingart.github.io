        <span class="first">The Powers that Press B</span> is a senior thesis project on cliche, and how game designers create authoritarian environments. It was born from a fascination with video game photography and creating art in a manufactured environment. The project was revisited and completely redesigned during the COVID-19 pandemic; with new content and source material. 
<br><br>
        <i>Statement: When creating authoritarian environments, video game designers will opt for the exaggerated and extreme to create more emotional reactions from the user.</i>
<br><br>        
        To prove my thesis statement, I used four video games for source material: <i>Grand Theft Auto V, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3,</i> and <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</i> In these games it’s not “you vs. bad guy,” it’s you vs. political organizations and corporate empires.  
<br><br>        
        I took nearly 400 photos. From the pictures I found shared design elements, spaces, objects, and cliches in the authoritarian environments. I also found pop-culture and real-life counterparts to these design elements. Playing into the “expose” and “anti-authoritarian” nature of the thesis, I took my findings and displayed them with a conspiracy corkboard. I put the common elements into groups, gave them descriptions, and used red strings to show the commonalities. After making the board, I made collages with my photos to create my own authoritarian base inspired by what I saw in the four video games. And after that, I made a booklet and website to catalog the thesis project. The final version is coming soon.
