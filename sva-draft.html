<p id="">
    <span class="first">SVA.edu 4.0</span> is a website redesign for the School of Visual Arts, an art and design college in New York City. 
<br><br>
    As the only full-time designer working exclusively on this project for over two years, I used Sketch, Principle, Zeplin, Framer, InVision, and Gitlab to design and prototype the site’s UI/UX, animations, and communicate tasks to developers. I was in charge of creating and exploring frontend and backend web components, maintaining design consistency across the site via a large Sketch library of dynamic components in multiple breakpoints, and (lots and lots of) QA testing.
<br><br>
    Overall, I made a total of ___ backend designs, ___ frontend designs, and ___ GitLab tickets.
<br><br>
    As part of the SVA’s in-house design studio, the Visual Arts Press, I worked with Gail Anderson, Eric Corriel, Brian Smith, Declan Van Welie, Ryan Durinick, Sam Potts, and Stephanie Gaito.
