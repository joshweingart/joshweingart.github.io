<p>
    <span class="first">SVA.edu 4.0</span>  is a website redesign for the School of Visual Arts, an art and design college in New York City. As part of the schoolâ€™s in-house design studio, Visual Arts Press, I worked with Gail Anderson, Eric Corriel, Brian Smith, Declan Van Welie, Ryan Durinick, Sam Potts, and Stephanie Gaito. I was the only full-time designer working exclusively on this project.
<br><br>
    There were several facets to my involvement with redesigning sva.edu. We needed a custom CMS built from from scratch. When creating CMS features we often had lengthy debates over their UX. For implementing features, I had to create a prototype to demonstrate it's functionality. We used four different prototyping programs throughout the project: InVision, Framer, Principle, and Sketch's built-in prototyping tool. The prototypes were then sent to our developers, which I communicated with each day via GitLab.
<br><br>
    Front-end redesign of sva.edu was done with Sketch, a program that I became very proficient in. In weekly design meetings with seven designers, I was in charge of implementing the design choices from the meetings. Thanks to my detailed knowledge of the project, I was responsible for maintaining design consistency across the frontend of sva.edu. I also made and maintained a huge Sketch library for all of our frontend design elements, and each element had to be made four times for each of our breakpoints.
<br><br>
    Throughout the project and more so once the design was finished, I performed QA testing to ensure the functionality and design were executed to our specifications. Any issues I saw were my responsibility to catalogue and report to our developers.
<br><br>
    Overall, I made a total of ___ backend designs, ___ frontend designs, and ___ GitLab tickets.
